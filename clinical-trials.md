# Clinical Trials Information Portal

## Problem Definition
Create a website that provides users with easy access to information about clinical trials. This platform will integrate with the clinicaltrials.gov API to fetch, display, and allow interaction with clinical study data. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface where users can efficiently search, filter, and analyze clinical trial information.

## Users
* **Primary Users:** Researchers, healthcare professionals, and biotech company employees.
* **How Users Use It:**
   * Search for clinical studies by disease name, condition, or NCT ID.
   * View clinical trial data in table or card formats.
   * Analyze data through sorting and filtering.
   * Navigate to detailed pages for in-depth information about specific trials.

## Plan

### Step 1: Define Requirements and Setup
* Identify core functionalities (search, view modes, sorting, filtering, etc.).
* Choose the technology stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS).
* Set up the project repository and development environment.

### Step 2: API Integration
* Integrate with clinicaltrials.gov API to retrieve study data.
* Build API utility functions for seamless data fetching.
* Handle API errors and implement fallback mechanisms.
* Primary API Endpoints:

    - Study Search: https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies?query.term=%3C%3Cdisease%3E%3E&countTotal=true

    - Study Details: https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies/[NCT_ID]

### Step 3: Develop Core Features

#### Version 0:
* **Basic Search Functionality:**
   * Implement search by disease name/condition and NCT ID.
   * Validate search inputs.
* **Data Display:**
   * Display data in table format.
   * Include essential fields (Study Title, NCT ID, Status, Intervention, Sponsor).
* **Error Handling:**
   * Show error messages for invalid inputs or API issues.

#### Version 1:
* **Advanced Features:**
   * Toggle between table and card views.
   * Add sorting capability for all data columns.
   * Implement filters for key fields (e.g., Status, Sponsor).
   * Enable users to customize visible columns.
* **Study Details Page:**
   * Create pages linked from Study Titles.
   * Display detailed information fetched via the API.

#### Version 2:
* **Performance Optimizations:**
   * Optimize API calls for efficient data fetching.
   * Improve rendering performance for large datasets.
* **User Experience Enhancements:**
   * Add responsive design for various devices.
   * Provide real-time feedback during data loading.

### Step 4: Testing and Refinement
* Conduct unit and integration testing.
* Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
* Refine the interface based on user feedback.

## Milestones
1. Completion of basic search functionality (Version 0).
2. Fully functional core features (Version 1).
3. Optimized performance and enhanced user experience (Version 2).

### Future Scope (Part 2)

* Integration with Open Target API for additional data fields:

    - Target
    - Modality
    - MoA (Mechanism of Action)

## Exit Criteria
The project is considered complete when:
* All core features are functional and meet the requirements.
* The application integrates seamlessly with the clinicaltrials.gov API.
* Performance requirements are achieved.
* User feedback confirms the interface is intuitive and responsive.
* Testing indicates no major bugs or usability issues.

## Project Deliverables
1. **Executable Application:** A functional web platform hosted on a public domain.
2. **Documentation:**
   * User guide for navigating and using the platform.
   * Developer guide detailing API integration and code structure.
   * Deployment guide for hosting and maintaining the platform.
3. **Source Code:** Organized and documented codebase.
4. **Test Cases:** Comprehensive test plans and results.

By following this structured plan, the Clinical Trials Information Portal will serve as a reliable and efficient tool for accessing and analyzing clinical trial data.

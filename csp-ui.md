# Problem Statement-Crystal Structure Prediction UI 

## Problem Definition
Researchers in drug development need to predict and analyze crystal structures of drug molecules through a multi-step process. Currently:
- The workflow is fragmented across different tools and interfaces
- There's no unified visualization system for crystal structures
- Researchers must manually transfer data between different stages
- Comparing multiple crystal structures is cumbersome
- Parameter adjustments require technical expertise

The solution needs to integrate three critical stages (3D conformation search, crystal structure landscape sampling, and preliminary screening) into a single, intuitive interface.

## Users and Use Cases
### Primary Users
- Computational Chemists
- Drug Development Researchers
- Crystal Structure Analysis Teams

### Usage Patterns
1. **Daily Workflow**
   - Upload molecular structures
   - Run conformational searches
   - Generate crystal structure predictions
   - Analyze and compare results
   - Export findings for reports

2. **Interaction Points**
   - Initial structure input
   - Parameter adjustment
   - Visualization and analysis
   - Result comparison
   - Data export

3. **User Requirements**
   - Minimal training needed
   - Clear visualization
   - Intuitive parameter controls
   - Quick access to comparison tools
   - Automated report generation

## Development Plan
### Phase 1: 3D Conformation Search
- Integration with existing Streamlit UI
- Visualization capabilities for Cluster Representatives
- Backend integration with existing code

### Phase 2: Crystal Structure Landscape Sampling
- Development of new UI components for:
  - Input handling of .xyz files from Phase 1
  - Parameter configuration (space group, Z value, method selection)
  - Generation of .cif files
  - Crystal density histogram visualization
- Integration with PyXtal backend

### Phase 3: Preliminary Screening
- Development of advanced visualization tools using nglview/ASE
- Implementation of interactive density vs. lattice energy plots
- Crystal structure comparison capabilities

## Milestones

# My Annotation System Project Plan

## Problem Definition
I'm building a foundational annotation system that will enable AI and humans to collaborate effectively. I need to create a system where users can view data in various formats, add annotations, and interact with both AI observations and human feedback. I'll use Next.js as my framework, Next Auth for authentication, and SQLite for data storage.

## Users
My system will be used by:
- Researchers and developers working with AI systems
- Anyone who needs to review and annotate AI outputs
- Teams collaborating on AI-assisted projects

How they'll use it:
- Log in using either traditional credentials or OTP via email
- View different types of data (CSV, text, graphs) through customizable widgets
- Add annotations, comments, and tags to any component
- Create composite views combining multiple data presentations
- Collaborate through shared annotations and feedback

## Plan
I'm breaking down the development into these key milestones:

### Phase 1: Authentication 
- Set up basic Next.js project
- Integrate Next Auth for authentication
- Implement both credential and OTP-based login
- Set up session management with configurable timeouts
- Create SQLite database for user data

### Phase 2: Component System 
- Create base component structure for displaying data
- Implement JSON-based component definition system
- Build initial widget types:
  - CSV display (table format)
  - Text display
  - Graph display
- Add support for component metadata and display preferences

### Phase 3: Composite Widgets
- Enable combining multiple widgets
- Create system for widget communication
- Implement composite widget example (graph + text description)
- Add dynamic widget type registration

### Final Phase: Annotation System 
- Add annotation support to all components
- Implement annotation storage in SQLite
- Create UI for adding/editing annotations
- Enable annotations on composite widgets
- Add user interaction features for annotations

## Exit Criteria
I'll know my project is complete when:

### Authentication
- Users can successfully:
  - Log in with username/password
  - Log in with email OTP
  - Maintain sessions for configured duration
  - Log out properly

### Component System
- System can:
  - Display CSV data as tables, cards, or graphs
  - Show text data properly
  - Handle composite widgets
  - Allow new widget type registration

### Annotation
- Users can:
  - Add annotations to any component
  - Edit their annotations
  - Delete annotations
  - View annotations linked to specific components

## Project Deliverables
What I'll deliver at the end:

### Software
- Complete Next.js application with:
  - Authentication system
  - Component rendering system
  - Annotation system
  - SQLite database integration

### Documentation
- Installation instructions
- User guide
- API documentation
- Database schema
- Component development guide

### Testing
- Test suite covering all major features
- Performance test results
- Security test results

I'll use this plan to track my progress and ensure I'm building exactly what's needed. The modular approach will let me test and verify each part before moving to the next phase.
